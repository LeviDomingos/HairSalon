                              <p class="card-text"> Very popular amongst African heritage <br> Things to know before you get a weave <br>
                                Afro hair allows for amazing versatility but there are some dos and don'ts when it comes to weaves:
                                Change your weave every 4-6 weeks <br>
                                To explain, weaves are extensions and are also a protective hairstyle if you're trying to grow your hair longer
                                or are trying to give your hair a rest from harmful heat styling. Your real hair is put into braids, and the 
                                weave is then sewn into them. <br>
                                I like using human hair extensions as they are of course the most natural. Human hair extensions can be bleached,
                                dyed, curled, straightened etc just as you can do with normal growing hair. Though good, ethical human hair 
                                extensions are quite expensive, they do last for a very long time if shampooed, conditioned and looked after properly.
                                <br>
                                However, if you're not careful, weaves can also damage your natural hair underneath as much as protecting it. 
                                For example, if the hair extensions are glued in or your braids have been created too tight, this will cause breakage. 
                                Hair underneath needs to be looked after with the same care you'd give it without your weave on top. 
                              </p>
                              <p>TIPS</p> 
                              <p>
                                Spend more for good quality hair. Cheap synthetic hair extensions can damage your natural hair and can cause scalp
                                irritation. Be alert for human hair extensions which are mixed in with synthetic hair and animal hair like Yaks or 
                                horses. (It is true, this happens). Make sure you check the hair thoroughly as well as making sure you wash it before
                                use to ensure that there are no insects hiding in the wefts that can damage or irritate your natural hair follicles. <br>
                                Is my hair protected Sew in, just like any other weave, has its ups and downs. They can protect your hair but if not 
                                “installed” correctly it can damage or break your hair. If you're trying to grow your hair out it's recommended that 
                                you install a “full head” of weave(which means none of the client's hair is left out.). <br>
                                Change it up Weaves should only be worn for 4-6 weeks at a time as your scalp needs to breathe! Wearing the same weave 
                                style for more than this time period without washing can lead to unsanitary conditions that can also lead to hair loss.
                                <br>
                                Care for your natural hair
                                <br>
                                It's important to deep condition natural hair before attaching a weave and to look after your natural hair, as traction 
                                alopecia can be developed from neglect. It's almost impossible to have an Afro hair transplant because of the way afro 
                                hair grows; CURLY.
                                <br>
                                Don't forget your scalp 
                                <br>Wrap up with a silk scarf before bed, sports or any activity that would cause sweat and be sure to wash and
                                blow-dry if there is excessive sweat. Also, treat your natural hair to deep conditioners and scalp treatments as much 
                                as you can and let your scalp breathe from time to time.

                              “installed” correctly it can damage or break your hair. If you're trying to grow your hair out it's recommended that 
                              you install a “full head” of weave(which means none of the client's hair is left out.). <br>
                              Change it up Weaves should only be worn for 4-6 weeks at a time as your scalp needs to breathe! Wearing the same weave 
                              style for more than this time period without washing can lead to unsanitary conditions that can also lead to hair loss.

                              Care for your natural hair
                              <br>
                              It's important to deep condition natural hair before attaching a weave and to look after your natural hair, as traction 
                              alopecia can be developed from neglect. It's almost impossible to have an Afro hair transplant because of the way afro 
                              hair grows; CURLY.

                              Don't forget your scalp 
                              <br>Wrap up with a silk scarf before bed, sports or any activity that would cause sweat and be sure to wash and
                              blow-dry if there is excessive sweat. Also, treat your natural hair to deep conditioners and scalp treatments as much 
                              as you can and let your scalp breathe from time to time.
